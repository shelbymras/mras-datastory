 	 		 	When I first thought about my digital practices the first thing that came 
 	 		 	to mind was how much I get distracted by notifications during my daily life.
 	 		 	Then I started thinking about how much I interact with those notification specifically
 	 		 	while I'm doing school work. That's when I started out on a five day long
 	 		 	data collection adventure, logging how many times I interacted with notifications
 	 		 	while doing school work. 
 	 		 	</p>
 	 		 	<p>
 	 		 	At the end of my collection I had logged data on what app notification distracted
 	 		 	me, while doing work for one of my five class, and for how long it distracted
 	 		 	me <em>(among other things)</em>. I found that text messages were my primary form of
 	 		 	distraction, and I mostly get distracted while doing work for my writing intensive
 	 		 	classes.

   	 			After I collected data on my personal digital practices, I was then challenged
   	 			to see how my practices are part of something bigger. Thats when I learned about
   	 			data brokering. The video below gives an overview of what data brokering
   	 			essentially is, and why the practice of data brokering is potentially invasive
   	 			to the average internet user. 
   	 			</p>
   	 			<p>
   	 			Through the creation of this video I learned about the information that is
   	 			constantly being collected about me, and millions of others without our 
   	 			knowledge. Though various government organizations like the FTC and FCC have called
   	 			for more transparency in data broker practices, there is still an overwhelming 
   	 			amount of information being collected daily about internet-users.
